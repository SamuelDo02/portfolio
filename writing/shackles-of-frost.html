                                The day that the sweet warmth of your voice<br>
                                Did not accompany the cold moonlight<br>
                                The past froze before me and with it, myself<br>
                                Kept behind as you were swept forward<br><br>
                                
                                Who can free me from listening to my heart<br>
                                By timeâ€™s heartbeat that has already stopped<br>
                                Who can free me from the thirst of my body<br>
                                When my soul thirsts for times long gone<br><br>
                                
                                Who can free me from counting the days<br>
                                By memories that counted my past<br>
                                Who can free me from watching the sunrise<br>
                                When my sun no longer rises for me<br><br>
                                
                                I am bounded by shackles of frost<br>
                                That bind my soul and freeze my heart<br>
                                Your warmth will never return<br>
                                But the chains will thaw just as time will
